# Tarantula
Automatically checks http response codes of websites and informs slack if they error


## How to use
1. Copy config-sample.json to config.json and fill out a period in seconds, slack webhook url, and a list of website urls to check

2. Use 'node .' to start taratula.  It will notify your slack channel if those websites go down.
